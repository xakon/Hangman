## Hangman

Famous hangman game. Guess the sentence and save hangman life.

### Requirements

+ Linux

The game probably won't work on Windows, because it clears the terminal in Linux specific way, likely. I didn't test in on Windows though.
I used the way from this repo: https://github.com/davidbegin/clear-terminal

### The sentence base

The sentences are taken from hangman\input.txt. You can add your own sentences to base. The sentence must be in newline and cannot contain the punctuation marks.
